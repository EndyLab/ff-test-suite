         Amino Acid Conservation Scores 
        =============================== 
 
- POS: The position of the AA in the SEQRES derived sequence. 
- SEQ: The SEQRES derived sequence in one letter code. 
- 3LATOM: The ATOM derived sequence in three letter code, including the AA's positions as they appear in the PDB file and the chain identifier. 
- SCORE: The normalized conservation scores. 
- COLOR: The color scale representing the conservation scores (9 - conserved, 1 - variable). 
- CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: When using the bayesian method for calculating rates, a confidence interval is assigned to each of the inferred evolutionary conservation scores. 
- CONFIDENCE INTERVAL COLORS: When using the bayesian method for calculating rates. The color scale representing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. 
- MSA DATA: The number of aligned sequences having an amino acid (non-gapped) from the overall number of sequences at each position. 
- RESIDUE VARIETY: The residues variety at each position of the multiple sequence alignment.
